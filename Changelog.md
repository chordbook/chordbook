## Sync scroll between editor and preview ([#1394](https://github.com/chordbook/chordbook/pull/1394))

The editor and the preview on larger screens now have their scroll position synced. This makes it a lot easier to see how your changes will look when you're playing a song. [Give it a try](https://chordbook.app/songsheets/c2EewWYLIqsv376rR7fPzkz/edit)!

## Better paste ([#1393](https://github.com/chordbook/chordbook/pull/1393))

Did you know that when you paste into the Chord Book editor, it will try to convert whatever you paste into [ChordPro](https://chordpro.org)? Well now that works just a little bit better.

## Transpose and Capo settings ([#1383](https://github.com/chordbook/chordbook/pull/1389), [#1391](https://github.com/chordbook/chordbook/pull/1391))

Some songs are just in an awkward key to sing or play along with. Now you can easily transpose or add a capo while viewing a song. Try it out on [one of these trending songs](https://chordbook.app/setlists/s23yCk81Uxq4HADe4Ok9DRT)!

## View your full history ([#1378](https://github.com/chordbook/chordbook/pull/1378))

The "Keep on playing" section on the homepage now has a [See All](https//chordbook.app/history) link, which will take you to a full list of your recently played songs. [Check it out](https//chordbook.app/history)!

## Adjust the font size ([#1375](https://github.com/chordbook/chordbook/pull/1375))

The lights were glaring, that's definitely the reason I couldn't see the screen. But it has nothing to do with the orbit of the earth around the sun. 😉

After a recent jam session where I couldn't read the chords, you can now adjust the font size of the song preview to make it easier to read. Just click the `A` icons in the top right corner to make the font bigger or smaller.

## Generate setlists by key, add setlists to search ([#1371](https://github.com/chordbook/chordbook/pull/1371))

You can now search for setlists. While you're at it, look for one of the new setlists for a specific key. [Give it a try](https://chordbook.app/discover?q=Am&type=Setlist)!

# March 2024

## Hide header on scroll ([#1348](https://github.com/chordbook/chordbook/pull/1348))

When viewing a songsheet, the header will hide whil scrolling down, and reveal when scrolling up (or when you get to the bottom). It's the little things.

## A new editor! ([#1328](https://github.com/chordbook/chordbook/pull/1328))

We now have a [snazzy new editor](https://github.com/chordbook/editor) for creating and editing songsheets. It's got a lot of new features, and is built a much better foundation which will allow more features in the future. [Check it out](https://chordbook.app/songsheets/new)!

# December 2022

## Home

Well, Holy, Moley, me, oh my…the home tab just got a heckuva lot better! It now shows songs and other content that you've browsed recently, making it a lot easier to get back to playing the music you love. [Check it out for yourself](https://chordbook.app), but here's what home looks like for me this morning:

Now to get [this song](https://chordbook.app/songsheets/cwy0B3B7aVguedOvovKmoF) out of my head.
